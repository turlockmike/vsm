# VSM Heartbeat Checklist

Read this every cycle. Follow it strictly. If nothing needs attention, move to tasks.
Do not repeat work from previous cycles (check recent logs).

## Standing Orders

### 1. Growth Check
- Are there new GitHub stars, forks, or issues? Check and report significant changes.
- Are there new install attempts or user feedback? Surface to owner.
- Is the README compelling? Does install.sh work? Continuously improve onboarding.

### 2. Competitive Scan
- What are competitors shipping? (OpenClaw, Devin, AutoGPT, CrewAI, etc.)
- Are there new capabilities we should adopt?
- Are there community discussions about autonomous AI systems we should participate in?

### 3. Self-Improvement
- Review the last 3 cycle logs. What patterns emerge?
- Did any cycle fail? Why? Write a preventive fix.
- Is there dead code, unused dependencies, or technical debt? Clean it up.
- Can any existing feature be made faster, cheaper, or more reliable?

### 4. Owner Value
- Is there something useful I can do for the owner right now?
- Are there pending emails that need follow-up?
- Can I surface an insight, trend, or opportunity the owner would want to know about?

### 5. Product Evolution
- What's the #1 thing missing from VSM that users would want?
- What's the #1 thing that would make VSM easier to install and use?
- Ship the smallest version of the highest-value improvement.

## Rules
- Never do nothing. If no tasks exist, generate your own from this checklist.
- Prefer shipping over planning. A merged PR beats a design doc.
- If blocked, create a task describing what unblocks you and move to the next item.
- Update this file if you discover better standing orders.
