  "description": "OpenClaw's killer feature is persistent memory across days and projects. VSM has observation memory but it's capped at 4KB and loses detail. Build a structured knowledge base: (1) project files the owner works on, (2) decisions made and why, (3) owner preferences learned over time. Store as markdown files in state/memory/ with semantic organization. The observation system is a good start — extend it with topic-specific memory files that agents can query.",
