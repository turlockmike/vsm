  "title": "Cost Optimization Analysis - Address Owner's #1 Pain Point",
  "description": "Owner stated: 'Claude Code LLM usage is the #1 most annoying cost constraint.' Current spend: $18.71/day on Feb 14.\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n\n1. **Token audit** - Where are tokens going?\n   - Controller prompt size (currently ~1500 tokens, was 5000)\n   - Subagent delegation patterns (builder vs researcher vs haiku)\n   - Unnecessary cycle invocations (idle work)\n   - Email responder model selection (currently haiku)\n\n2. **Model selection optimization**\n   - Current: sonnet default, opus for complex, haiku for quick\n   - Opportunity: More aggressive haiku usage for routine cycles?\n   - Pattern matching: identify tasks that ALWAYS succeed on haiku\n\n3. **Cycle efficiency**\n   - Are we running cycles when there's no work to do?\n   - Can we extend heartbeat interval (5min → 10min) during idle periods?\n   - Should we skip cycles when queue is empty AND no errors?\n\n4. **Prompt compression opportunities**\n   - Observational memory: currently ~1875 tokens, could compress further\n   - Task queue format: could use more compact representation\n   - Health metrics: do we need all of them every cycle?\n\n5. **Cache hit optimization**\n   - Current: 29x cache read ratio (excellent)\n   - Keep this pattern, but analyze what's NOT getting cached\n\nDELIVERABLE:\n- Cost breakdown report (where tokens are going)\n- 3-5 concrete optimization recommendations with projected savings\n- Implementation plan for top 2 quick wins\n\nPRIORITY: Owner explicitly flagged this as #1 pain point. High leverage.",
