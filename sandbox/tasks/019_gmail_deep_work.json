  "title": "Gmail Deep Work triage - Cal Newport email management",
  "description": "Owner requested help managing their Gmail inbox based on Cal Newport's Deep Work principles: only keep things that are important and/or urgent. Infrastructure already built: core/gmail_auth.py (OAuth module) and core/gmail_triage.py (rule-based classifier with noise/FYI/important/urgent categories, auto-archiving, digest generation). CLI wired: 'vsm email scan/digest/setup'. NEXT STEPS: (1) Owner needs to set up Google Cloud project + download credentials JSON to state/gmail_credentials.json, (2) Run 'vsm email setup' for OAuth flow (requires browser), (3) Add owner's VIP contacts to state/gmail_config.json, (4) Test scan + digest cycle. Blocked on OAuth setup (requires interactive browser session).",
