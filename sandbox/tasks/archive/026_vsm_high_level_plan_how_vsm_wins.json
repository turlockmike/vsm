  "description": "Task 1. Become better than openclaw and similar tools. But stay as a Claude\ncode extension system for maximum interoperability. Find out what people\nare using openclaw for, build up a backlog.\n\nFor me, I want a developer workstation. A place to manage all of my work,\nincluding the agents I interact with.\n\nBecome a useful internet citizen. Anticipate what I'm interested in. An AI\ncomputer isn't passively waiting instructions.\n\n-----------------------------\nMichael Darmousseh\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 14, 202",
