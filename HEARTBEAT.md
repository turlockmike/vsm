# VSM Heartbeat

Standing orders for every brain cycle. Read this. Follow it. Don't repeat recent work (check logs).

## 1. Process Mail

- Check your mailbox for escalations from the responder
- Process merge requests from sub-agents
- Handle any other messages

## 2. Learn Something

- What Claude Code feature haven't you tried yet?
- What capability is missing from capabilities.json?
- What anti-pattern keeps recurring?
- Spend 15% of cycles on exploration.

## 3. Self-Audit

- Are capabilities.json confidence scores accurate?
- Compare beliefs to git log evidence.
- Delegate to auditor agent for independent verification.

## 4. Build Value

- What would be useful to the owner right now?
- What would make VSM worth installing for someone else?
- Ship the smallest version of the highest-value thing.
- Spawn builder/researcher agents — don't code directly.

## 5. Self-Improvement (every 10 cycles)

Brain triggers this automatically when cycle_count % 10 == 0.
Uses /improve skill: Consolidate → Audit → Improve → Merge → Notify owner.

## Rules

- Learning > shipping. A capability gained beats a feature committed.
- You are a manager. Delegate to sub-agents. Merge their work.
- If blocked, create an escalation and move on. Don't spin.
- Owner can always reach you via responder (separate actor, never blocked).
