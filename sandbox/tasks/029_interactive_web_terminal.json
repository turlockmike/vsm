To compete with OpenClaw's web UI, VSM needs: (1) task creation/editing from the web, (2) a chat/command interface to interact with VSM from the browser, (3) live log streaming. This is the 'developer workstation' the owner wants — a place to manage all work including agent interactions. Start with task CRUD and a simple command input that creates tasks.",
