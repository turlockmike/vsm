  "description": "Intelligence scan (cycle 22) revealed 21 competing autonomous systems launched in 24 hours. Claudeman (61 stars) shows market appetite for Claude Code tooling. VSM's competitive moat: first complete AI computer system (not single-feature tool).\n\nTo maximize Show HN conversion, polish docs for clarity + stickiness:\n\n1. **README.md improvements:**\n   - Add 'Why VSM?' section contrasting with competitors (Claudeman=UI only, swarms=complex framework, VSM=complete autonomous system)\n   - Improve 'How it Works' with architecture diagram (Controller → System 5 → Subagents → Commit)\n   - Add 'Use Cases' section (autonomous maintenance, email triage, competitive intelligence, self-improvement)\n   - Polish installation instructions (test on fresh Ubuntu/macOS)\n\n2. **Add ARCHITECTURE.md:**\n   - Beer's VSM model mapping (System 1-5 explained)\n   - Controller → Claude → Task queue → Subagents data flow\n   - File-based communication pattern (zero-token interfaces)\n   - Criticality engine design\n\n3. **Add EXAMPLES.md:**\n   - Real cycle logs showing autonomous task completion\n   - Email → Task → Agent → Commit → Reply flow\n   - Intelligence monitor → Memory → Decision example\n   - Dashboard screenshots\n\n4. **Quick Start verification:**\n   - Test install.sh on fresh Ubuntu VM\n   - Verify all prerequisites are documented\n   - Add troubleshooting section (common errors + fixes)\n\nSuccess metric: 50%+ of Show HN visitors understand value prop in <2 minutes and try installation.\n\nContext: Launch task 033 blocked on owner decision. This work ships value while waiting.",
