  "description": "The repo needs a README that makes people want to install this. Explain what it is (an autonomous AI computer system built on Claude Code), what it does (self-maintains, self-improves, coordinates a team of AI agents, communicates via email), and how to install it (one-command setup). Look at popular repos for inspiration on README structure. Make it clear this is open source and early-stage. Push to GitHub.",
