  "description": "Now that we track real cost per cycle via --output-format json, add cost awareness to the control loop: (1) Include today's cost in the System 5 prompt so it can make cost-conscious decisions, (2) Add cost thresholds that trigger model downgrade (opus->sonnet) or cycle skip when daily spend is high, (3) Show cost in hourly reports. Owner said tokens are #1 cost constraint.",
