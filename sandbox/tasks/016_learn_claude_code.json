  "result": "Studied entire v0-v8 progressive agent architecture guide. Key learnings saved to memory/claude_code_patterns.md. Created 3 VSM skills (system-maintenance, task-planning, shipping) applying the Skills pattern from v4. Most impactful patterns: (1) Skills = hot-swappable expertise via SKILL.md files, (2) 3-layer context compression (microcompact/auto-compact/disk), (3) file-based communication > API-based, (4) task dependency graphs with auto-unblocking, (5) teammate pattern with persistent identity and shared task board."
