  "description": "OpenClaw's killer feature is persistent memory across days and projects. VSM has observation memory but it's capped at 4KB and loses detail. Build a structured knowledge base: (1) project files the owner works on, (2) decisions made and why, (3) owner preferences learned over time. Store as markdown files in state/memory/ with semantic organization. The observation system is a good start — extend it with topic-specific memory files that agents can query.",

  "result": "Shipped persistent memory system. Created state/memory/ with projects.md, decisions.md, preferences.md. Built core/memory.py with load_memory(), append_to_memory(), 8KB token budget. Controller already integrated (line 265). System 5 now has structured knowledge base that persists across days. Memory stats: 3 files, 5.2KB total. OpenClaw competitive gap closed."
